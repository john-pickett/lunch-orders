# Lunch Orders

## Summary

An excellent perk at many businesses is ordering lunch for their employees. The business generally decides which restaurants will be offered, the employees submit their individual orders, and then the whole order is called into the restaurant and delivered to the office. The employees are then charged the appropriate amount for their lunch.

This project provides a simple method of tracking these lunch orders. It allows a secretary to update a list of offered restaurants, while employees can input their lunch order. Each day, a secretary can see all of the orders for that day to call in the big order, and the Finance department can total up each employee's bill at the end of the week.
